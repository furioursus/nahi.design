# Deploy notifications

Telegram messages on deploy success/failure, via a local Netlify Build Plugin — no relay server, no third-party automation platform. The plugin runs inside Netlify's own build process and calls Telegram's Bot API directly.

## How it's built

- **`plugins/telegram-notify/`** — a [local Netlify Build Plugin](https://docs.netlify.com/extend/develop-and-share/develop-build-plugins/) (not published to npm — just a directory Netlify loads by relative path). `index.js` exports `onSuccess` and `onError`, two of the plugin lifecycle hooks Netlify calls during every build/deploy; each POSTs a short HTML-formatted message to `https://api.telegram.org/bot<token>/sendMessage`.
- **`netlify.toml`** — registers the plugin via `[[plugins]] package = "./plugins/telegram-notify"`. Deliberately has no `[build]` section: build command and publish directory stay configured in the Netlify dashboard rather than being duplicated here, so this file can't drift out of sync with (or silently override) whatever's set there.

## Setup (one-time, per Netlify site)

1. **Create the bot** — message [`@BotFather`](https://t.me/BotFather) on Telegram, `/newbot`, save the token it gives you.
2. **Get chat IDs** — each person who wants notifications messages [`@userinfobot`](https://t.me/userinfobot); it replies with their numeric ID directly. Each person also needs to message the bot itself at least once (e.g. `/start`) — Telegram won't let a bot DM someone who hasn't started a conversation with it first.
3. **Set two environment variables** in the Netlify dashboard (Site settings → Environment variables) — `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN`, and `TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID` (one ID, or a comma-separated list to notify several people — e.g. `111111,222222`). Both **must** live there, never in `netlify.toml` or anywhere in this repo — it's public.

Nothing else to wire up — the plugin picks up both vars from `process.env` at build time, and DMs every ID in `TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID` independently.

## Gotchas

- **Missing env vars don't fail the build.** `sendTelegramMessage` in `index.js` checks for both vars up front and just logs a warning + returns if either is missing, rather than throwing. A notification hiccup (forgotten env var, Telegram API error, rate limit) should never be able to take the actual site deploy down with it — same reasoning for why a non-`ok` Telegram API response is logged, not thrown, and why a bad ID in a multi-recipient `TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID` list doesn't stop the rest from being notified (each ID's `sendMessage` call is independent, sent in parallel via `Promise.all`).
- **`onError` only covers the build/deploy stage**, not post-deploy issues (CDN propagation, edge function runtime errors after the fact) — it fires when the build command or Netlify's own build process fails, which covers "deploy broke" in the common case (bad commit, failing build step) but isn't a full uptime monitor.
- **Message length.** Telegram caps messages at 4096 characters; `onError` truncates the error text to 500 chars so a long stack trace doesn't dump illegibly into a chat notification — check the Netlify deploy log for the full error, the Telegram message is a pointer, not a substitute.
- **`SITE_NAME`/`URL`/`CONTEXT`/`BRANCH`** are [standard Netlify build environment variables](https://docs.netlify.com/configure-builds/environment-variables/) — no extra config needed for the plugin to read them, they're already present in every build's `process.env`.
- **Commit message isn't one of those env vars** — Netlify exposes `COMMIT_REF` (the SHA) but not the message, so `getCommitMessage()` shells out to `git log -1 --pretty=%s` instead, reading it straight from the repo the plugin is already running inside. Subject line only, wrapped in try/catch so a shallow clone or any other git hiccup drops the line rather than the build. Freeform text like a commit subject (or the error message in `onError`) gets `escapeHtml()`'d before going into the message — `parse_mode: "HTML"` treats `<`/`>`/`&` as markup, and an unescaped commit message or stack trace containing any of those could otherwise mangle or truncate the notification.
- **`URL`, not `DEPLOY_PRIME_URL`, for the link in the message.** `DEPLOY_PRIME_URL` looks like the obvious choice but varies by deploy context — it's only the real custom domain for a genuine production deploy; for a branch deploy it's `<branch>--sitename.netlify.app` instead, and it's always populated either way, so a `DEPLOY_PRIME_URL ?? URL` fallback never actually falls through. `URL` is the one Netlify documents as constant across every deploy regardless of context — use that as primary, `DEPLOY_PRIME_URL` only as a defensive fallback if `URL` is ever unset. (If you see a `<branch>--sitename.netlify.app`-shaped URL anywhere you expected the real domain, it's usually a sign the site's Production branch isn't set to match what you're pushing to — check Site settings → Build & deploy → Branches.)

Same pattern as the one on [furioursus.dev](https://github.com/furioursus/furioursus.dev/tree/main/plugins/telegram-notify), ported over — the flavor text is different, the mechanics are identical.
